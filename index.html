    <h2 class="Subheader">An About Me Page</h2>
    <p class="About">My name is Batyrkhan Alimzhanov, I am a Junior at Staten Island Technical High 
        School and I am very excited to start the new year. As everyone knows, junior 
        year brings a lot to the table: extra work, more challenges, and more opportunities. 
        I just hope to navigate through all of this and come out stronger than I started. 
        Plus, I have a lot of plans that I can't wait to bring to life. For me personally, it will be 
        very interesting as I have just about all of my periods filled with college classes. So far, 
        as I got to know my teachers from the first couple of days I really enjoy the experience.
        I thank you for taking the time to read my message.
