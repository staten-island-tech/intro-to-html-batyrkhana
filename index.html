    <h2>An About Me Page</h2>
    <p>My name is Batyrkhan Alimzhanov, I am a Junior at Staten Island Technical High 
        School and I am very excited to start the new year. As everyone knows, junior 
        year brings a lot to the table: extra work, more challenges, and more opportunities. 
        I just hope to navigate through all of this and come out stronger than I started. 
        Plus, I have a lot of plans that I can't wait to bring to life. I thank you for 
        taking the time to read my message.
    </p>
